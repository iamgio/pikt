# runConfigurations
This folder can be imported into IntelliJ IDEA to use pre-made run/debug configurations.

In order to import these configurations, just duplicate this folder under `.idea/`, so that IntelliJ will handle the rest.

You will eventually need to [set properties](../README.md#properties).
